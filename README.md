# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Simple-Networking


## 📘 Objective

Design a network in **Cisco Packet Tracer** to connect the **ACCOUNTS** and **DELIVERY** departments, implementing best practices in cabling, IP addressing, and testing.

---

## 🧩 Network Design Requirements

- 🖥️ Each department (**ACCOUNTS** and **DELIVERY**) must include **at least two PCs**.
- 🧷 Use an appropriate number of **switches** and **routers** to connect all devices.
- 🌐 Base the design on the IP network: `192.168.40.0/24`.
- 📋 Configure:
  - Correct **IP addresses** for all interfaces
  - **Subnet masks** for each device
  - Appropriate **default gateways** for host PCs
- 🔌 Use **correct cabling types** for all connections (e.g., straight-through, crossover).
- ✅ Perform end-to-end **communication tests** between devices in both departments.


# 🖧 Cisco Packet Tracer Network Design Project

## 📘 Objective

Design a network in **Cisco Packet Tracer** to connect the **ACCOUNTS** and **DELIVERY** departments using appropriate devices, IP addressing, and connectivity.

---

## 🧩 Network Requirements

- 🖥️ Each department (**ACCOUNTS** and **DELIVERY**) must contain **at least two PCs**.
- 📶 Use an appropriate number of **switches** and **routers** to interconnect the devices.
- 🌐 IP addressing must be based on the **192.168.40.0/24** network.
  - Assign correct **IP addresses**, **subnet masks**, and **default gateways** to all interfaces.
- 🔌 Use **appropriate cables** to connect all devices (copper straight-through, crossover where necessary).
- ✅ Verify **end-to-end communication** between PCs in the ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments using the `ping` command.

## 💻 Technologies Implemented

This project demonstrates key networking fundamentals using Cisco Packet Tracer and includes the following implementations:

- 🛠️ **Creating a Simple Network**  
  Designed a basic LAN topology using a **Router** and an **Access Layer Switch**.

- 🔌 **Correct Cabling of Network Devices**  
  Connected PCs, switches, and routers using appropriate cable types (straight-through and crossover).

- 🌐 **Connecting Two Networks via a Router**  
  Enabled communication between two different subnets using a **single router**.

- 🧮 **Subnetting and IP Addressing**  
  Applied custom subnetting on the `192.168.x.x/24` network to efficiently allocate IP ranges.

- 📟 **IP Configuration on Router Interfaces**  
  Assigned **IPv4 static IPs** to each interface of the router based on the subnet plan.

- 🖥️ **Static IP Assignment to End Devices**  
  Manually configured static IP addresses on host machines (PCs) within each subnet.

- ✅ **Testing and Verifying Communication**  
  Used `ping` and other diagnostic tools to validate network connectivity across all devices and departments.

> 📁 All configurations were completed in **Cisco Packet Tracer**, and results were verified through simulation mode and successful ping tests.
