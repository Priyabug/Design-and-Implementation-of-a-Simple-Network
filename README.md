# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Simple-Networking


Design a network in  Cisco Packet Tracer to connects ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments through the following:
Each department should contain at least two PCs.
Appropriate number of switches and routers should be used in the network.
Using the given network 192.168.40.0, all interfaces sould be configured with correct IP addresses, subnet mask and gateways.
All devices in the network should be connected using appropriate cables.
Test communication between devices in both ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments.

## 🧩 Network Requirements

- 🖥️ Each department (**ACCOUNTS** and **DELIVERY**) must contain **at least two PCs**.
- 📶 Use an appropriate number of **switches** and **routers** to interconnect the devices.
- 🌐 IP addressing must be based on the **192.168.40.0/24** network.
  - Assign correct **IP addresses**, **subnet masks**, and **default gateways** to all interfaces.
- 🔌 Use **appropriate cables** to connect all devices (copper straight-through, crossover where necessary).
- ✅ Verify **end-to-end communication** between PCs in the ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments using the `ping` command.
